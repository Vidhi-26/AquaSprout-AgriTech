# Flourish-AgriTech
Flourish AgriTech aims to produce quality vegetables & fruits that are best for your health. With its hydroponics and aquaponics set-up, plants receive nutrients from fish metabolites while fish thrive in the water that purified by plants. Sensors for temperature, light, water flow & pH level are powered by IoT technology. When any inconsistency is detected by a sensor, an alert is sent to the user via the mobile app, which also shows detailed stats, charts & graphs to monitor the daily growth of vegetables. Increased level of quality control allows consumers to get residue-free veggies throughout the year, including exotic veggies. Created the business pitch of Flourish AgriTech, created the website with HTML,CSS,JS & prototyped the mobile app with Figma.
