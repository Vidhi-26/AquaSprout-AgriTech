# AquaSprout-AgriTech
A hydroponics and aquaponics set-up to produce quality vegetables & fruits, best for your health. Developed and pitched the idea of AquaSprout Agri-Tech, a startup that uses Flourish, its hydroponics and aquaponics set-up with IoT & mobile integration. Plants receive nutrients from fish metabolites while fish thrive in the water that purified by plants. Sensors for temperature, light, water flow & pH level are powered by IoT. When any inconsistency is detected by a sensor, an alert is sent to the user via the mobile app, which also shows detailed stats, charts & graphs to monitor the daily growth of vegetables. Increased level of quality control allows consumers to get residue-free veggies throughout the year, including exotic veggies. Created the business plan of AquaSprout Agri-Tech, created the website with HTML,CSS,JS & prototyped the mobile app with Figma.
